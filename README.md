# Source code and set of scripts to experiment with streaming over a CCNx controled environment

This repository contains the source code of a simple simulation that explores the performance of streaming over a CCNx infrastructure. It also contains a set of scripts to set up the infrastructure and control the experiment execution in a set of distributed machines using Python Fabric library.

This version of the experiment uses the Java CCNx library.
